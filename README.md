# [LaTeX Search](https://github.com/lunaroyster/LaTeX-search/blob/master/README.md)

## Goals:

* Reduce the learning curve for LaTeX beginners
* Improve workflow while using LaTeX

## How to contribute:

The file containing LaTeX commands is located at src/Commands.js

Fields:

* `descriptions`: How someone would search for the command. Example: 'square root'
* `example`: A typical use of the command, used to generate the LaTeX preview
* `command`: The command itself. This is copied.

More fields will be added later.
